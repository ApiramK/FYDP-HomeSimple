"40059790","What a fantastic location for this beautiful Cape Cod style home! Only minutes from the expressway, the 401, Fairview Park Mall and so much more. A renovation completed in 1995 added a beautiful sunken master bedroom with a cathedral ceiling and an attached garage. The main floor offers an eat-in kitchen with a peninsula moveable island with room for your microwave oven and many handy pullout shelves. There are gorgeous wide plank oak hardwood floors in the Living room / Dining room and the kitchen / dinette area. A walkout from the rear hall to a partially covered sundeck. The upper level has 3 generous sized bedrooms and a full 4 piece bathroom smartly updated with a modern vanity, vinyl plank floor and sliding glass doors on the tub/shower. Added bonus is the finished basement. Here you will find a cozy recreation room accented with knotty pine paneling and a 3 piece bath with ceramic tile floor and corner shower. Some valuable upgrades and extras include a rear yard shed (16' x 8') with hydro, a 100 amp service on breakers, a newer air conditioner (2018), all appliances (in as-is condition), water softener and so much more!
